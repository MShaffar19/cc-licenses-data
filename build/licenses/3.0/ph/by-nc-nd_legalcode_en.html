For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical work, performance or sound recording, audiovisual work, or fixation, the synchronization of the work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an adaptation for the purpose of this license.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>

A work that constitutes a collection will not be considered an adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this license.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Distribute"
   </strong>
   means to make available to the public the original and copies of the work or adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

  </li>
  <li>

   3. License Grant.
  </strong>
  Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, the licensor hereby grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the work as stated below:
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   To reproduce the work, to incorporate the work into one or more collections, and to reproduce the work as incorporated in the collections; and,
  </li>
  <li>
   To distribute and publicly perform the work including as incorporated in collections.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make adaptations. All rights not expressly granted by the  licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4. Restrictions.
  </strong>
  The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   You may distribute or publicly perform the work only under the terms of this license. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this license with every copy of the work you distribute or publicly perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the work that restrict the terms of this license or the ability of the recipient of the work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the license. You may not sublicense the work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this license and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the work you distribute or publicly perform. When you distribute or publicly perform the work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the work from you to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the license. This Section 4(a) applies to the work as incorporated in a collection, but this does not require the collection apart from the work itself to be made subject to the terms of this license. If you create a collection, upon notice from any licensor you must, to the extent practicable, remove from the collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  </li>
  <li>
   You may not exercise any of the rights granted to you in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you distribute, or publicly perform the work or collections, you must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means you are utilizing: (i) the name of the original author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the original author and/or licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in the licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that the licensor specifies to be associated with the work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, you may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising your rights under this license, you may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the original author, licensor and/or attribution parties, as appropriate, of you or your use of the work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the original author, licensor and/or attribution parties.
  </li>
  <li>
   For the avoidance of doubt: The licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by you of the rights granted under this license that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).
  </li>
  <li>
   Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognized and not waivable by applicable law.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   6. Limitation on Liability.
  </strong>
  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY, INCIDENTAL, MORAL, NOMINAL, TEMPERATE OR MODERATE, LIQUIDATED, EXEMPLARY OR CORRECTIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   7. Termination
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by you of the terms of this license. Persons, whether natural or juridical, who have received collections from you under this license, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such persons remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this license.
  </li>
  <li>
   Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the work). Notwithstanding the above, the licensor reserves the right to release the work under different license terms or to stop distributing the work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this license (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this license), and this license will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   8. Miscellaneous
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   Each time you distribute or publicly perform the work or a collection, the licensor offers to the recipient a license to the work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to you under this license.
  </li>
  <li>
   If any provision of this license is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this license, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  </li>
  <li>
   No term or provision of this license shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  </li>
  <li>
   This license constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the work not specified here. The licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from you. This license may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the licensor and you.
  </li>
