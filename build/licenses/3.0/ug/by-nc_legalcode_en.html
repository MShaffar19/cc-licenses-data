   1. Definitions
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Derivative Work"
   </strong>
   means a work based
          upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing
          works, such as a translation, adaptation, arrangement of
          music or other alterations of a literary or artistic
          work, or phonogram or performance and includes
          cinematographic derivative work or any other form in
          which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
          including in any form recognizably derived from the
          original, except that a work that constitutes a
          Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for
          the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt,
          where the Work is a musical work, performance or
          phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
          timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
          considered Derivative Work for the purpose of this
          Licence.
  </li>

   <p>
    <strong>
     "Collection"

          in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
          and arrangement of their contents, constitute
          intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
          its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
          other contributions, each constituting separate and
          independent works in themselves, which together are
          assembled into a collective whole. A work that
          constitutes a Collection will not be considered a
          Derivative Work (as defined above) for the purposes of
          this Licence.

          other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,
          interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works
          or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
          phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
          who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other
          sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the

  Nothing in this

        free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or

  <strong>
   3. Licence Grant.
  </strong>
  Subject to the terms
        and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants the
        User a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
        (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
        exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   <p>
    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
          one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
          incorporated in the Collections;
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    to create and Reproduce Derivative Work provided that
          any such Derivative Work, including any translation in
          any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
          demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
          the original Work. For example, a translation could be
          marked "The original work was translated from English to
          Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
          work has been modified.";
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
          as incorporated in Collections; and,
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform Derivative
          Work.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The above rights may be exercised in all media and
        formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
        rights include the right to make such modifications as are
        technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
        and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
        expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
        including but not limited to the rights set forth in
        Section 4(d).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4. Restrictions.
  </strong>
  The licence granted in
        Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
        the following restrictions:
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   <p>
    The User may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
          only under the terms of this Licence. The User must
          include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
          (URI) for, this Licence with every copy of the Work the
          User Distributes or Publicly Performs. The User may not
          offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
          terms of this Licence or the ability of the recipient of
          the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
          under the terms of the Licence.
   </p>
   <p>
    The User may not sublicense the Work.
   </p>
   <p>
    The User must keep intact all notices that refer to
            this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with
            every copy of the Work Distributed or Publicly
            Performed by the User.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the User Distributes or Publicly Performs the
            Work, they may not impose any effective technological
            measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
            recipient of the Work from the User to exercise the
            rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
            Licence.
   </p>
   <p>
    This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
            incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
            the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
            subject to the terms of this Licence.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the User creates a Collection, upon
            notice from any Licensor, the User must, to the extent
            practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
            required by Section 4(c), as requested.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the User creates a Derivative Work, upon notice
            from any Licensor the User must, to the extent
            practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit
            as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The User may not exercise any of the rights granted
          to them in Section 3 above in any manner that is
          primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
          advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange
          of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
          digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered
          to be primarily intended for or directed toward
          commercial advantage or private monetary compensation,
          provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation
          in connection with the exchange of copyrighted
          works.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If the User Distributes, or Publicly Performs the
          Work or any Derivative Work or Collections, they must,
          unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),
          keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
          provide, reasonable to the medium or means they are
          utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
          pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
          Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
          or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
          journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
          Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
          reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)
          the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
          reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
          specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
          does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
          information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with
          Section 3(b), in the case of Derivative Work, a credit
          identifying the use of the Work (e.g., "French
          translation of the Work by Original Author," or
          "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
   </p>
   <p>
    The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
            implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
            however, that in the case of Derivative Work or a
            Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
            credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative
            Work or Collection appears, then as part of these
            credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
            credits for the other contributing authors.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the avoidance of doubt, the User may only use
            the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
            attribution in the manner set out above and, by
            exercising rights under this Licence, the User may not
            implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection
            with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
            Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
            appropriate, of that User's use of the Work, without
        the separate, express prior written permission of the
        Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
        Parties.

              whether individually or, in the event that the
              Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
              administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
              society, from any exercise by the User of the rights
              granted under this Licence that is for a purpose or
              use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
              permitted under Section 4(b).

   5. Representations, Warranties and

  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN

   7. Termination
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   <p>
    This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will

          have received Derivative Work or Collections from the
          User under this Licence, however, will not have their
          licences terminated provided such individuals or entities
          remain in full compliance with those licences. Sections

    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
          licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of

          the above, the Licensor reserves the right to release the
          Work under different licence terms or to stop
          distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
          any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence
          (or any other licence that has been, or is required to

  <strong>
   8. Miscellaneous
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   <p>
    Each time the User Distributes or Publicly Performs
          the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the
          recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms and
          conditions as the licence granted to the User under this
          Licence.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Each time the User Distributes or Publicly Performs
          Derivative Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
          licence to the original Work on the same terms and
          conditions as the licence granted to the User under this
          Licence.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If any provision of this Licence is invalid or
          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this Licence, and without further action by the
          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
          reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
          provision valid and enforceable.

  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed
          waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
          consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
          charged with such waiver or consent.

  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between
          the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
          are no understandings, agreements or representations with
          respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
          not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
          in any communication from the User. This Licence may not
          be modified without the mutual written agreement of the
          Licensor and the User.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter
          referenced, in this Licence were drafted utilizing the
          terminology of the Uganda Copyright and Neighbouring
          Rights Act no.19 of 2006, the Berne Convention for the
          Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
          September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
          WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
          Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
          Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights
          and subject matter take effect in Uganda or relevant
          jurisdiction in which the Licence terms are sought to be
          enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
          implementation of those treaty provisions in the
          applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights
          granted under applicable copyright law includes
          additional rights not granted under this Licence, such
          additional rights are deemed to be included in the
          Licence; this Licence is not intended to restrict the
          license of any rights under the Uganda Copyright and
          Neighbouring Rights Act no.19 of 2006 or any other
          applicable law.
