 </h3>
 <p>
  THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE
          TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE
          ("LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
          OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
          AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
          PROHIBITED.
 </p>
 <p>
  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE,
          YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
          LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
          HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
          AND CONDITIONS.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   1. Definitions
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Collection"
   </strong>
   means the Work in its
            entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
            other separate and independent works, assembled into a
            collective whole. A Collection may, for example,
            include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A
            Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for
            the purposes of this Licence.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Derivative Work"
   </strong>
   means material in any form that is created by editing,
            modifying or adapting the Work, a substantial part of
            the Work, or the Work and other pre-existing works.
            Derivative Works may, for example, include a
            translation, adaptation, musical arrangement,
            dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording,
            art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
            other form in which the Work may be transformed or
            adapted, except that a Collection will not be
            considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
            Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
            a musical composition or sound recording, the
            synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
            moving image ("synching") will be considered a
            Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Distribute"
   </strong>
   means to make
            available to the public by any means, including
            publication, electronic communication, or
            broadcast.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Licensor"
   </strong>
   means the individual,
            individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work
            under the terms of this Licence.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Original Author"
   </strong>
   means the
            individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
            the Work.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Reproduce"
   </strong>
   means to make a copy
            of the Work in any material form (eg storage in digital
            form).
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Work"
   </strong>
   means the material
            (including any work or other subject matter) protected
            by copyright which is offered under the terms of this
            Licence. This may include (without limitation) a
            literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; a sound
            recording or cinematograph film; a published edition of
            a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or a
            television or sound broadcast.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "You"
   </strong>
   means an individual or
            entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not
            previously violated the terms of this Licence with
            respect to the Work, or who has received express
            permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
            this Licence despite a previous violation.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit,
          or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
          arising from limitations or exceptions under copyright
          law or any other applicable laws.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3. Licence Grant
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    3A Grant of Rights
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Provided that the terms set out in this Licence are
          satisfied, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide,
          royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration
          of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the
          following rights:
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   Reproduce the Work;
  </li>
  <li>
   incorporate the Work into one or more
            Collections;
  </li>
  <li>
   Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any
            Collection;
  </li>
  <li>
   create and Reproduce one or more Derivative Works;
            and
  </li>
  <li>
   Distribute and publicly perform the Work, a
            Derivative Work or the Work as incorporated in any
            Collection.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    3B Media and Formats
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The above rights may be exercised in any media or
          format whether now known or hereafter created. They
          include the right to make modifications that are
          technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
          media and formats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    3C Other Rights Reserved
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are
          reserved. The Licensor waives the right to collect
          royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
          under this Licence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4. Restrictions
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The licence granted above is limited by the following
          restrictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    4A Restrictions on Distribution and Public
          Performance of the Work
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   You may Distribute and publicly perform the Work
            only under the terms of this Licence.
  </li>
  <li>
   You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
            Identifier (such as a web link) for, this Licence with
            every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly
            perform.
  </li>
  <li>
   You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work
            that restrict this Licence or the ability of a
            recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
            granted to them by this Licence.
  </li>
  <li>
   You are not granted the right to sublicense the
            Work. The rights of recipients of the Work from You are
            governed by clause 9.
  </li>
  <li>
   You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
            Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
            copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly
            perform.
  </li>
  <li>
   When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work,
            You must not impose any technological measures on it
            that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
            from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this
            Licence.
  </li>
  <li>
   For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A
            applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection,
            it does not require other material within the
            Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work
            itself, to be made subject to this Licence.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    4B Attribution and Notice
          Requirements
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>
   When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or
            any Derivative Work or Collection You must keep intact
            all copyright notices for the Work.
  </li>
  <li>
   When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or
              any Derivative Work or Collection You must provide,
              in a manner reasonable to the medium or means You are
              using:
   <ol type="i">
    <li>
     the name or pseudonym (if provided) of the
                Original Author and/or of any other party (such as
                a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal)
                that the Original Author or Licensor has requested
                be attributed (such as in the copyright notice or
                terms of use). In this clause 4B these parties are
                referred to as "Attribution Parties";
    </li>
    <li>
     the title of the Work (if provided); and
    </li>
    <li>
     to the extent reasonably practicable, any
                Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link)
                that the Licensor specifies should be associated
                with the Work that refers to the copyright notice
                or licensing information for the Work.
    </li>
   </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
   For any Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly
            perform, You must take reasonable steps to clearly
            identify that changes were made to the Work. For
            example, a translation could be marked "The original
            work was translated from English to Spanish".

  <li>
   In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the
            above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part
            of any credits for other contributing authors and be as

   For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the

              attribution in the manner set out above. By
              exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must

     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original

    4C Moral Rights
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are
          recognised and nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4C,
          "moral rights" means the personal rights granted by law
          to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example,
          Part IX of the
  <em>
   Copyright Act 1968
  </em>
  (Cth) grants
          authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right
          of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have
          authorship falsely attributed.

            supply of goods or services of a kind ordinarily
            acquired for personal, domestic, or household use.
            Clauses 6(a) and 6(b) cannot and are not intended to

   7. Termination
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This Licence and the rights granted to You under this
          Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by
          You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals or entities
          who have received a Derivative Work or a Collection from
          You pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have
          their licences terminated provided they remain in full
          compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8,
          9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of
          this Licence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   8. Licensor’s Rights
          Retained
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here
          is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
          copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the
          Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
          different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work
          at any time. However, any such release will not serve to
          withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been
          granted under the terms of this Licence), and this
          Licence will continue in full force and effect unless
          terminated as stated above.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work
          from You
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work,
          a Derivative Work or a Collection the Licensor offers the
          recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms as are
          granted to You under this Licence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   10. Severability
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  If any provision of this Licence is invalid or
          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this Licence. Without further action by the
          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
          reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
          provision valid and enforceable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   11. Waivers and Consents
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no
          breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in
          writing and signed by the relevant party.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   12. Entire Agreement
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between
          the parties. To the full extent permitted by law, there
          are no understandings, agreements or representations with
          respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor
          shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
          appear in any communication from You. This Licence may
          not be modified without the written agreement of the
          Licensor and You.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   13. Governing Law
  </strong>
 </p>
